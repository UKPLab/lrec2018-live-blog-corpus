In this project, we develop a corpus for Live Blog Summarization. This repository contains scripts to generate live blog summarization corpus using
The Guardian and BBC live blogs.

> **Abstract:** Live blogs are an increasingly popular news format to cover breaking news and live events in online journalism. 
Online news websites around the world are using this medium to give their readers a minute by minute update on an event.
Good summaries enhance the value of the live blogs for a reader but are often not available.
In this paper, we study a way of collecting corpora for automatic live blog summarization.
In an empirical evaluation using well-known state-of-the-art summarization systems, we show that live blogs corpus poses new challenges in the field of summarization.
We make our tools publicly available to reconstruct the corpus to encourage the research community and replicate our results.
